# Bayesian-MSC

Bayesian implementation of the Multispecies Coalescent model for two species.

The MSC model has two parameters: the species divergence time ($\tau = T\mu$) and the
population size parameter  = 4N for the H-C common ancestor. Here T is the divergence
time in generations between the two species, N is the (effective) population size of the
ancestral species, and  is the mutation rate per site per generation. Both  and  are measured
in the number of mutations per site.
